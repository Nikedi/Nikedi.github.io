<article>
<p>I have put on making a “making of” for too long and now at least a couple of weeks, maybe a month, has passed since i started this project. It might be incomplete as I probably have a hard time remembering all the changes i have done (as i did not start this as a git repo).</p>
<h2 id="The-idea">The idea</h2>
<p>For a long time I have had the concept of a personal website in mind but have never come to bring them to life. The closest i got was with a old website I build a couple of years ago.</p>
